Question 1  :-	What shapes have constant Euclidean curvature?  

Answer  :-	Straight lines and Circles.


Explanation:- The Euclidean curvature  for straight lines is zero , and for circles is 1/radius .



Question 2  :-The gradient of a function f(x,y) is	

Answer  :-	Perpendicular to the level lines of f(x,y).



Question 3  :-	Consider the functional (Integral|Del I|p) for an image I(x,y) and p   > 0. For which p the Euler-Lagrange of the functional will lead to anisotropic diffusion?

Answer  :-	p=1.  


Explanation:- 	For p = 1 this gives "curvature motion", a type of anisotropic diffusion. For p = 2 this gives the isotropic diffusion or heat flow. For p > 2 we also get additional diffusion across edges instead of reduced diffusion.


Question 4  :-	Considering a planar curve C embedded as the zero level set of a function f(x,y). The curve moves with constant velocity. Then f(x,y) is deforming according to 

Answer  :-	ft = |`Del` f|.


Explanation:- 	general motion is ft = V * |`Del` f| when the curve is moving with speed V in the normal direction. In this case (constant motion) V = 1. 



Question 5  :-	Consider a circle of radius 1/8. What is the relationship between the affine arc-length dv and the Euclidean arc-length ds for this circle?

Answer  :-	dv = 2 * ds


Explanation:- 	dv = `kappa` ^ (1 / 3) ds, and since the radius is 1/8, the curvature `kappa` is 8.



Question 6  :-	Consider a planar shape in an image, with its boundary deforming with only tangential velocity. What will happen to the object inside such boundary?

Answer  :-	It will not change.  

Explanation:- 	Tangential motion does not change the shape of a curve and its surrounding shape



Question 7  :-	Considering an image with only circular objects of known radius. Which of the following techniques would you use to detect their centers: 

Answer  :-	Hough Tranform
