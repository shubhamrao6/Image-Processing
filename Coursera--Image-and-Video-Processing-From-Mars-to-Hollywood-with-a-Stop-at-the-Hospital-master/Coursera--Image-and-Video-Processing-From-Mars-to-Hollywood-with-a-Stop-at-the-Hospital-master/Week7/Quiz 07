Question 1  :-	Consider the general image inpainting form {IMAGE IN QUESTION} , meaning we propagate the information L in the direction {IMAGE IN QUESTION} to the gradient of the image. What will happen if instead of propagating the Laplacian of I as in the video, we propagate the image I itself?  


Answer  :-	Any inpainted region will solve the basic equation {Grad L . N = 0 }  for this choice.  
  



Question 2  :-	Consider a region to be inpainted with `N` missing pixels, in an image with `M` pixels total. In the "smart cut-and-paste" algorithm, how many patch comparisons will need to be performed if a single pixel is inpainted per match? Consider only the order of magnitude, ignoring image boundaries for example.  
 

Answer  :-	N*M

Explanation:-   For each pixel to be inpainted, we have to compare to all patches centered at each one of the M image pixels, and therefore we have a total of `N * M` searches. 




Question 3  :-	For a given image `I`, {IMAGE IN QUESTION} is equal to (`div` stands for the divergence)  


Answer  :-	The Euclidean curvature of the image level lines.  




Question 4  :-	Consider that you have an image with a single circle, and a small part of it is covered and needs to be inpainted. What would you use for that?   

Answer  :-	Hough Transform  




Question 5  :-	Assume you have a fast moving rigid object in a video, that needs to be removed (inpainted). Which one of the following operations is expected to do a good inpainting job? If you think that more than one option is possible, pick the one that will produce the best result and/or is the simplest one.  
 

Answer  :-	Temporal median filtering: The pixels in the region to be inpainted are replaced by the median of pixels in the same (x,y) spatial location and at different frames t (median of (x,y,t) for t in some time interval with the current frame at its center).  


Explanation:- Median will work since the majority of the pixels are un-occluded for a given time window whereas a Gaussian will mix occluded and un-occluded pixels and then will not perform as well. A cut-and-paste is expensive technique.




Question 6  :-	How would you detect scratches in an old movie, knowing they are vertical straight lines? 
Answer  :-	With Hough Transform




Question 7  :-	Assume the above scratches are a single pixel wide and appear in relatively uniform areas, how would you inpaint them? 

Answer  :-	Simple Linear Transform
