Question 1  :-	What is the dictionary used in JPEG?  

Answer  :-	Discrete cosine transform (DCT).
  



Question 2  :-	Consider a 2×4 dictionary D composed of the transpose of the 2-dimensional atoms (0,1), (1,1), (0,1), and (2,1) (these form the columns of D). The sparsest representation of the vector x=(2,2) is given by the transpose of (these are the `alpha`):  
 

Answer  :-	( 0,2,0,0)



Question 3  :-	We want to obtain sparse representations of signals of dimension N = 64. We have a dictionary with k = 100 atoms. How many possible active sets (subspaces) we have with sparsity L = 3?  


Answer  :-	(100!)/((97!)*(3!))  



Question 4  :-	Consider the Gaussian Mixture Model in the last video. We want to use it to represent signals in N = 64 dimensions. If we have k = 100 Gaussians in the mixture, then the number of possible active sets (subspaces) is  

Answer  :-	100


Question 5  :-	Are sparse modeling and compressed sensing the same?  


Answer  :-	No, sparse modeling is about signal models and representations; compressed sensing is about an efficient novel data acquisition protocol.  



Question 6  :-	What needs to change in the general expression of image denoising we used for sparse modeling (equation in slide 4 of the 1st video this week) if instead of Gaussian additive noise we consider other types of additive noise?  

Answer  :-	We need to change the data fitting term, relationship with measurements, from a quadratic penalty to a penalty tailored to the noise.  




Question 7  :-	Consider a dictionary D composed of both the complete DCT basis and the complete Fourier basis, a concatenation of both. Will the representation of a signal be unique when using such dictionary?  


Answer  :-	No, there will be at least two different possible representations for all signals.  



Question 8  :-	Consider you have a dictionary composed of 100 random 10×10 patches from the given image. If you perform sparse coding with this dictionary:  


Answer  :-	


Question 9  :-	Consider a video and use the patches of the current frame as dictionary for encoding the next frame. For scenes with only static objects:  


Answer  :-	This results in veery sparse codes on average
